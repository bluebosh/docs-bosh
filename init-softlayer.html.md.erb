title: Creating environment on SoftLayer
---

This document shows how to create new [environment](terminology.html#environment) on SoftLayer.

## <a id="prepare"></a> Step 1: Prepare a SoftLayer Environment

To prepare your SoftLayer environment:

* [Create a SoftLayer account](#account)
* [Generate an API Key](#api-key)
* [Access SoftLayer VPN](#vpn)
* [Order VLANs](#vlan)

---
### <a id="account"></a> Create a Softlayer account

If you do not have an SoftLayer account, [create one for one month free](https://www.softlayer.com/promo/freeCloud).

Use the login credentials received in your provided email to login to SoftLayer [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com).

---
### <a id="api-key"></a> Generate an API Key

API keys are used to securely access the SoftLayer API. Follow [Generate an API Key](http://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/generate-api-key) to generate your API key.

---
### <a id="vpn"></a> Access SoftLayer VPN

To access SoftLayer Private network, you need to access SoftLayer VPN. Follow [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access) to access the VPN. You can get your VPN password from your [user profile](https://control.softlayer.com/account/user/profile). Follow [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access) to access the VPN.

---
### <a id="vlan"></a> Order VLANs

VLANs provide the ability to partition devices and subnets on the network. To order VLANs, login to SoftLayer [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com) and navigate to Network > IP Management > VLANs. Once on the page, click the "Order VLAN" link in the top-right corner. Fill in the pop-up window to order the VLANs as you need. The VLAN IDs are needed in the deployment manifest.

---
## <a id="deploy"></a> Step 2: Deploy

1. Install [CLI v2](./cli-v2.html).

1. Establish VPN connection between your host and Softlayer. The machine where to run CLI needs to communicate with the target Director VM over the SoftLayer private network.

1. Use `bosh create-env` command to deploy the Director.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    # Create directory to keep state
    $ mkdir bosh-1 && cd bosh-1

    # Clone Director templates
    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment

    # Fill below variables (replace example values) and deploy the Director
    $ bosh interpolate bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
        -o bosh-deployment/softlayer/cpi.yml \
        -v internal_ip=10.0.0.6 \
        -v dns_recursor_ip=8.8.8.8 \
        -v director_name=bats-director \
        -v sl_director_fqn=<sl_hostname_prefix>.<sl_domain> \
        --vars-file <( ~/Downloads/softlayer_credentials.json ) \
        --vars-store director-creds.yml \
        > director.yml

    $ sudo bosh create-env \
        --state director-state.json \
        --vars-store director-creds.yml \
        director.yml
    </pre>

    <p class="note">Note: The reason why need to run `bosh create-env` command with sudo is that it needs to update `/etc/hosts` file which needs suffient permission.</p>

1. Connect to the Director.

    <pre class="terminal">
    # Configure local alias
    $ bosh alias-env bosh-1 -e 10.0.0.6 --ca-cert <(bosh int ./director-creds.yml --path /default_ca/ca)

    # Log in to the Director
    $ export BOSH_CLIENT=admin
    $ export BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=`bosh int ./director-creds.yml --path /admin_password`

    # Query the Director for more info
    $ bosh -e bosh-1 env
    </pre>

1. Save the deployment state files left in your deployment directory `bosh-1` so you can later update/delete your Director. See [Deployment state](cli-envs.html#deployment-state) for details.
